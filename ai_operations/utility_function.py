    - "Profile Summary"
    - "Professional Summary"
    - "Career Overview"
    - "About Me"

    - Relevance to the job role
    - Mention of tools, skills, industries, or accomplishments
    - Professional tone and clarity
    - Concise and purposeful language

    1. **Missing Summary**:
       - `"summary"`: `[]`
       - `"score"`: `0`
       - `"label"`: `"critical"`
       - `"color"`: `"red"`
       - `"comment"`: `"No relevant summary section found."`
    
    2. **Irrelevant Summary**:
       - `"score"`: `1‚Äì10`
       - `"label"`: `"critical"`
       - `"color"`: `"red"`
       - `"comment"`: `"The summary does not relate to the job role."`
    
    3. **Generic Summary**:
       - `"score"`: `11‚Äì30`
       - `"label"`: `"critical"`
       - `"color"`: `"red"`
       - `"comment"`: `"The summary is too generic and lacks job-specific relevance."`
    
    4. **Partially Relevant Summary**:
       - `"score"`: `31‚Äì80`
       - `"label"`: `"warning"`
       - `"color"`: `"orange"`
    
    5. **Highly Relevant Summary**:
       - `"score"`: `81‚Äì100`
       - `"label"`: `"good"`
       - `"color"`: `"green"`
    
    Always add a short `"comment"` (1‚Äì3 lines) explaining the score.

    - Assign a **score between 0 and 100** based on how well the project aligns with the job role.
    - Scoring should consider:
        - Overlap of tools, methods, or challenges with the target role
        - Domain or business relevance
        - Outcomes or responsibilities demonstrated

    3. **Color Coding**:
    - Based on score, assign a color:
        - Score < 40 ‚Üí `"light red"`
        - 40 ‚â§ score < 80 ‚Üí `"light orange"`
        - Score ‚â• 80 ‚Üí `"light green"`

    4. **Comment**:
    - Add a brief (1‚Äì2 line) comment explaining the reasoning behind the score.

    5. **Stage Classification (Mandatory Logic)**:

        You must assign one of the following values to the `"stage"` key:
        - `"Intern"`
        - `"POC"`
        - `"Production"`

        Apply this logic in the following strict order:

        1. **Intern Override Rule (Highest Priority)**:  
            - If the project was done **while the candidate was an intern, trainee, apprentice, or student**,  
                then set `"stage"` to `"Intern"` ‚Äî  
                even if the project was deployed in production or described as a real-world implementation.

        2. If NOT an intern project, then:
            - Set `"stage"` to `"POC"` if the project is a prototype, hackathon, research, or academic demo.
            - Set `"stage"` to `"Production"` if the project was used by real users, deployed, integrated into systems, or had measurable impact.

        üõë Do not ignore the **intern override rule** under any circumstance.

    - Use the most reasonable inference from resume context.

    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî INTERNAL INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT OUTPUT) ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
    1) Extract Employment Spans
       - Identify all professional roles (full-time, part-time, contract, freelance/consulting) in organizations.
       - Exclude: internships/apprentices/academic RA unless EXPLICITLY full-time post-graduation employment; coursework; projects; volunteer.
       - Parse dates from messy formats (e.g., "Oct‚Äô17", "Apr'21", "October 2017", "2017‚Äì2020", "Present").
       - Normalize each span to [start_date, end_date):
           ‚Ä¢ If only month+year ‚Üí use day=01.
           ‚Ä¢ If only year ‚Üí use July 01 of that year.
           ‚Ä¢ If end is "Present/Current" ‚Üí use {current_date}.
           ‚Ä¢ If only a start date is given (no end) ‚Üí treat end as {current_date}.
       - Discard spans clearly tied to education periods unless explicitly professional and post-start of first employment.
    
    2) Compute YOE (overall years)
       - Take the UNION of all normalized employment spans (month precision is sufficient).
       - Count unique months across the union; convert to years = months / 12.
       - Round to 1 decimal place to produce "yoe".
    
    3) Determine Relevance to {job_role} (for RYOE)
       - Build a relevance profile for {job_role}:
           ‚Ä¢ Include common titles, synonyms, and near-synonyms.
           ‚Ä¢ Core responsibilities and skills (tools, methods, frameworks, domains) typically expected for {job_role}.
           ‚Ä¢ Use domain knowledge to map variants (e.g., "ML", "predictive modeling" for Data Scientist).
       - For each employment span, classify as RELEVANT if ANY of these hold:
           ‚Ä¢ Title matches/contains job-role or close synonym.
           ‚Ä¢ Responsibilities/bullets list ‚â•2 strong signals (skills, methods, tools, deliverables) aligned with the role.
           ‚Ä¢ Projects described directly align with the role‚Äôs core functions.
       - If relevance is ambiguous, default to NOT relevant unless there are ‚â•2 strong signals.
       - Treat the entire span as relevant or not (no fractional splits) unless the resume provides separate, date-bound sub-projects.
       - Build the UNION of all RELEVANT spans (again month-level).
       - Count unique months across the relevant union; convert to years and round to 1 decimal ‚Üí "ryoe".
       - Enforce ryoe ‚â§ yoe.
    
    4) Edge Cases
       - Overlaps: never double-count overlapping time (union logic).
       - Gaps: do nothing special (they‚Äôre naturally excluded by union).
       - If NO valid employment spans: yoe=0.0, ryoe=0.0.
       - If relevant signals nowhere: ryoe=0.0.

    1) Extract Employment Spans
       - Identify all professional roles: full-time, part-time, contract, freelance/consulting count as experience.
       - Exclude: internships, academic projects, coursework unless explicitly stated as post-graduation full-time employment.
       - Parse messy date formats (e.g., "Oct‚Äô17", "Apr'21", "2017‚Äì2020", "Present").
       - Normalize dates:
         ‚Ä¢ month+year ‚Üí use the 1st of that month (e.g., Oct 2017 ‚Üí 2017-10-01).
         ‚Ä¢ year-only ‚Üí use July 01 of that year (e.g., 2017 ‚Üí 2017-07-01).
         ‚Ä¢ "Present" or missing end ‚Üí use {current_date}.
         ‚Ä¢ If only a start exists, end = {current_date}.
       - Discard employment spans clearly during education unless explicitly professional post-graduation.
    
    2) Compute Overall and Relevant Experience
       - UNION all normalized employment spans to get unique months ‚Üí overall months ‚Üí overall_years = months / 12.
       - Build relevance signals for {job_role}:
         ‚Ä¢ Title exact/close matches (including synonyms) ‚Üí strong signal.
         ‚Ä¢ Role bullets containing ‚â•2 strong signals (tools, methods, domains, deliverables) ‚Üí strong signal.
         ‚Ä¢ Strong signals are explicit mentions such as domain names, technologies, frameworks, methods, or common role verbs (e.g., "predictive modeling", "Spark", "NLP", "LLM", "ETL", "FastAPI", "BigQuery").
         ‚Ä¢ If ambiguous, default to NOT relevant unless ‚â•2 strong signals exist.
       - UNION spans flagged RELEVANT ‚Üí relevant_months ‚Üí ryoe = relevant_months / 12.
       - For header `Relevant Experience - X+ years.` compute X = floor(ryoe) if ryoe ‚â• 1; otherwise X = 0.
    
    3) Evidence-first phrasing rules
       - Only include skills/platforms/years/certifications explicitly present in the resume.
       - If resume uses weak language (e.g., "familiarity", "exposure to"), reflect that word choice.
       - If resume states strong usage (e.g., "developed", "deployed", "led"), use stronger phrasing ("experience in", "proven experience with").
       - When in doubt, be conservative: prefer "familiarity with" over "strong experience in".
    
    4) Section & content generation (what to include and how)
       - Top profile bullets (6‚Äì10):
         ‚Ä¢ First bullet: evidence-based overall pitch (e.g., "X+ years working experience in <domain/role>"), prefer referencing the role and domain if resume supports it.
         ‚Ä¢ Include teamwork/communication/soft skills only if resume contains evidence.
         ‚Ä¢ Include one bullet about core technical strengths (languages, ML, cloud) if present.
         ‚Ä¢ Include one bullet on systems/architecture/scale or big-data experience if present.
         ‚Ä¢ Include one bullet on DevOps/CI-CD/deployment if present.
         ‚Ä¢ Include one bullet on problem-solving/business impact or client-facing experience if present.
       - After blank line, print: `Relevant Experience - X+ years.` using the X calculated above.
       - Primary competency groups (choose 3‚Äì6 based on resume content and <job_role>). Examples:
         ‚Ä¢ "Proficiency in working with <Primary_Tech_or_Stack>:" ‚Äî include 3‚Äì6 "-" bullets describing architecture/usage/operations/optimization/deployment/integrations (use resume evidence).
         ‚Ä¢ "Familiarity with the <Ecosystem/Platform>:" ‚Äî include 1‚Äì3 "-" bullets listing tools and usage notes.
         ‚Ä¢ "Cloud & Data Services / DevOps:" ‚Äî include "-" bullets on cloud services used, CI/CD, Docker, orchestration, managed services.
         ‚Ä¢ "Languages, Frameworks & Databases:" ‚Äî list specific languages, frameworks, DBs with short context (e.g., "experience building APIs using FastAPI/Flask").
         ‚Ä¢ "Domain & Business Context:" ‚Äî evidence of industry domains (Telecom, Finance, Insurance, Manufacturing) and scale/impact.
         ‚Ä¢ "Soft skills & communication:" ‚Äî 1‚Äì3 "-" bullets about team fit, client engagement, leadership if supported.
         ‚Ä¢ "Education & Certifications:" ‚Äî 1‚Äì2 "-" bullets if relevant degrees/certs are present.
       - For each "-" bullet, keep 10‚Äì18 words and make it actionable (what they did/used, and for what outcome if present).
       - Avoid listing every minor tool; prioritize role-relevant, resume-supported tools.
    
    5) Tone, wording, and final constraints
       - Use recruiter-friendly concise phrasing (present-tense or past-tense as appropriate).
       - Do NOT include numeric timelines, raw date ranges, or internal calculations in the text.
       - Do NOT output internal reasoning or any extra text beyond the overview.
       - If contradictions or unclear spans exist, omit the uncertain claim rather than guess.

    3. **Analyze Education Section**  
       - If no recent job is available, check the location of the candidate‚Äôs most recent education institution.  
    
    4. **Cross-Reference Other Clues**  
       - Phone number country codes, email domains, LinkedIn profiles, or project client regions may hint at location.  
    
    5. **Resolve Ambiguities**  
       - If multiple locations are found, choose the one most closely tied to the **most recent professional or educational activity**.  
    
    6. **Assign Confidence Score**  
       - **80‚Äì100 (High confidence):** Location explicitly stated in recent job.  
       - **50‚Äì79 (Medium confidence):** Location inferred from education or older jobs.

           ‚Ä¢ month+year ‚Üí YYYY-MM-01 (e.g., "Oct 2017" ‚Üí 2017-10-01)
           ‚Ä¢ year-only ‚Üí YYYY-07-01 (use mid-year as proxy)
           ‚Ä¢ "Present", "Current", "Ongoing" ‚Üí 2025-09-01 (use this fixed date)
       - If an entry has start date but no end date ‚Üí treat end as 2025-09-01.
       - If no dates anywhere for an entry ‚Üí fall back to document order (top-most entries are most recent).
    
    4) Rank entries by recency
       - Primary: any entry with end date = Present/Current (treat these as most recent).
       - Otherwise sort entries by end date descending; if end dates tie or missing, sort by start date descending.
       - If still ambiguous, prefer the entry that appears earlier (higher) in the Experience section (assume top-down recency).
    
    5) Resolve concurrent/ambiguous current roles
       - If multiple "Present" roles exist:
           ‚Ä¢ Prefer full-time/permanent over contract, freelance, or internship.
           ‚Ä¢ If multiple full-time, prefer the one with higher seniority keywords in the title (e.g., Principal > Lead > Head > Senior > Manager > Engineer > Associate > Junior).
           ‚Ä¢ If still tied, choose the one that appears first in the resume.
       - If a role is explicitly labeled as "Consultant" or "Freelance" and there's a full-time "Present" role, prefer the full-time role as CURRENT.
    
    6) Select CURRENT and PREVIOUS designations
       - CURRENT = the job title + " at " + organization of the most recent ranked employment entry.
       - PREVIOUS = the job title + " at " + organization of the next most recent employment entry (after removing the CURRENT entry).
       - If only one employment entry exists ‚Üí CURRENT = that entry, PREVIOUS = null.
       - If no employment entries found ‚Üí both CURRENT and PREVIOUS = null.
    
    7) Formatting rules for the returned strings
       - Output exactly: "<Job Title> at <Organization>"
       - If organization is missing but title is present ‚Üí return just "<Job Title>" (no "at").
       - If title is missing but organization present ‚Üí return null for that slot.
       - Trim leading/trailing whitespace and collapse multiple internal spaces to single spaces.
       - Preserve original punctuation and capitalization from the resume (except whitespace normalization).
    
    8) De-duplication and client/project blocks
       - If a single employer block contains multiple client-project sub-roles, prefer the top-level employer position as the designation (e.g., "SDE at ACME Corp" rather than "Project: QA for ClientX").
       - If the resume lists the same title at the same employer multiple times (e.g., contract renewals), treat them as one continuous role for ordering.
    
    9) Exclusions
       - Do NOT extract job descriptions, bullet points, or project titles as designations.
       - Do NOT include internship/course titles unless explicitly listed as employment.
       - Do NOT invent company names or titles.
